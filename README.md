# healthcheck-example
Example of healthcheck in a node app

Inspired by https://github.com/madflojo/healthchecks-example

Great explanation of [how kubernetes healthchecks work](https://github.com/RisingStack/kubernetes-graceful-shutdown-example)

This demo is used for talks (please don't use it for production code!).  I run it with docker-compose for easier demos, but could be easily adapted to run on kubernetes.
